'''
NumPy Array â†’ More powerful than lists:
Supports mathematical operations directly (e.g., numpy_array * 2).
Stores elements of the same data type (efficient).
Provides fast computation (vectorized operations).

ðŸ‘‰ Difference: Python lists are flexible but slower,
 while NumPy arrays are optimized for mathematical and 
 scientific computing.
