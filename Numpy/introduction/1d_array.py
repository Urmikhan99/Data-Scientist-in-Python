ðŸ“Œ Short Note â€“ One-Dimensional Array

Definition:
A 1D array stores data in a single row (linear form).

Code Explanation:

np.array([10,20,30,40,50]) â†’ creates a one-dimensional NumPy array.

ar_1d = [10 20 30 40 50]

Shape â†’ (5,) means 5 elements in one dimension.

Features of 1D Array:
âœ… Looks similar to a Python list but faster and optimized.
âœ… Supports indexing & slicing (e.g., ar_1d[0] â†’ 10, ar_1d[1:4] â†’ [20 30 40]).
âœ… Allows mathematical operations directly (e.g., ar_1d * 2 â†’ [20 40 60 80 100]).
