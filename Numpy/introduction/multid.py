ðŸ“Œ Short Note â€“ Multi-Dimensional Array (Matrix)

Definition:
A multi-dimensional array has more than one dimension.

1D â†’ single row (linear)

2D â†’ rows & columns (matrix)

Higher dimensions â†’ arrays inside arrays (like 3D cubes).

Code Explanation:

np.array([[2,4,6],[8,9,12]]) â†’ creates a 2D matrix with 2 rows Ã— 3 columns.

Shape â†’ (2, 3) â†’ 2 rows, 3 columns.

Features of Multi-Dimensional Arrays:
âœ… Efficient for handling large data (e.g., images, datasets).
âœ… Indexing by row & column (e.g., matrix[0,1] â†’ 4, matrix[1,2] â†’ 12).
âœ… Can perform matrix operations (addition, multiplication, transpose, etc.).
